# 3D Printed Case

With access to a 3d printer, you can skip lasercutting the BASE parts.  Use the 3d printable BASE.stl here.  Uses M3 Heat Sets instead of nuts.

You can use one of the default .stl files, or use the .scad file and OpenSCAD to make your own configuration.  

Recommend cutting the object smaller to fit your print bed, or adding glue tabs to help with assembly.
