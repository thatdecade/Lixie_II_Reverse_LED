Here you will find the files for the PCB.  

To order the PCBs pre-assembled, visit [pcbshopper](https://pcbshopper.com/) and click the Assembly tab.  Then you can fill out the form and compare pricing from different assemblers.

* Lixie_II_Reverse_LED_BOM.xlsx
* Lixie_II_Reverse_LED_PLACEMENT.xlsx

**Notes:** 

- If you don't have EagleCAD to open the .brd/.sch files, you can use the free version of Autodesk Fusion 360 and download Eagle Free.
- You can use the .brd file to generate the LIGHTFILTER.dxf.  Simply hide all layers on the board, then select only the dxf layer and hit export to dxf.
